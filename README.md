# Angular2 RxJs playground

This repo serves as a playground for Angular2 and RxJs. 

Based on [angular2-webpack-starter](https://github.com/angular-class/angular2-webpack-starter/). Good job [@gdi2290](https://github.com/gdi2290)!

### Quick start
> Clone/Download the repo then edit `app.ts` inside [`/src/app/components/app.ts`](https://github.com/SekibOmazic/angular2-rx/blob/master/src/app/components/app.ts)

```bash
$ npm start
```


# Getting Started
## Dependencies
What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm` (`brew install node`)
* Ensure you're running the latest versions Node `v0.12.2`+ and NPM `2.10.0`+

Once you have those, you should install these globals with `npm install -global`:
* `webpack` (`npm install -global webpack`)
* `webpack-dev-server` (`npm install -global webpack-dev-server`)

## Installing
* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `npm install` to install all dependencies
* `npm run server` to start the server

## Running the app
After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app. Run `npm server` to start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://localhost:8080`.
 
### server
```bash
$ npm run server
```

### build files
```bash
$ npm run build
```

### watch and build files
```bash
$ npm run watch
```

# TypeScript
> To take full advantage of TypeScript with autocomplete you would have to install it globally and use an editor with the correct TypeScript plugins.

## Use latest TypeScript compiler
TypeScript 1.5 beta includes everything you need. Make sure to upgrade, even if you installed TypeScript previously.

    $ npm install -global typescript@^1.5.0-beta

## .d.ts Typings
The typings in `typings/` are partially autogenerated, partially hand
written. All the symbols should be present, but probably have wrong paramaters
and missing members. Modify them as you go.

    $ npm install -global tsd
 > You may need to require `reference path` for your editor to autocomplete correctly
 ```
 /// <reference path="../../typings/tsd.d.ts" />
 /// <reference path="../custom_typings/ng2.d.ts" />
 ```
 Otherwise including them in `tsd.json` is prefered 

## Use a TypeScript-aware editor
We have good experience using these editors:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Webstorm 10](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) with [TypeScript plugin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) with [Typescript-Sublime-Plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/Typescript-Sublime-plugin#installation)


### Todo
* production/development environments
* testing
* e2e
* production services examples
* hot-component-reloading
